              Submissions or any part thereof.
            </p>
            <p>

              person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the
              manner contemplated by the Site, the Service and this Agreement;
              and (iii) the posting/publishing of User’s User Submissions on or
              through the Service or otherwise does not violate the privacy
              rights, publicity rights, intellectual property rights, contract
              rights, or any other rights of any person or entity. User agrees
              to pay all royalties, fees, and other monies owing any person or
              entity by reason of any content posted by User to or through the
              Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              In connection with User Submissions, User further agrees that User

              liability in connection with User Submissions.

              foregoing, Fillaneed assumes no responsibility for monitoring the
              Service for inappropriate content, or modifying or removing such
              content from the Service.
